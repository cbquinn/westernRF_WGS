Step 1: downsample Alaska and Washington bams
To sample size of East (17.0) and Russia (13.0)

RFID | popID | depth | 
---|---|---
S10-0511_RF23	| WAC_S10-0511 | 24.6 | 
S12-1159_RF43 | 	AK_S12-1159 | 24.7 |
S11-0008_RF1 | SN_S11-0008 | 33.6 | 

These are the fractions I need to subsample bams at for the 24x ones
s_13x | s_17x
--- | ---
0.528 | 0.691

For SN, these are the ones I need to do
s_25x = 0.735
s_13x = 0.506
